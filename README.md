# **Welcome, I'm Rlack97.**

## **Code is element of world**


I'm beginner programer studing **Python3**, **html**, **css**, **django**.

## **Someday, my codes will change worlds.**

My major is **Sociology**.

I learn how this sociey works, and many inequality.

I hope that my codes can reduce parts of them.
<br/><br/>

## **Challenging Objects**
I'm interested in frontend.

Maybe somebody says It's too red ocean,

but In these days, every job in this world is rea ocean, I think.

so I will challenge some frontend programs like **javascripts and Vue**.
